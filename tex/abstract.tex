	Social media are becoming more and more popular and are used to discuss a
	wide range of topics. On these platforms we are often experiencing
	polarization between the users, producing a clear separation between
	groups with different opinions. Echo Chambers are closely related to this
	phenomenon: an Echo Chamber is a group of users with the same beliefs
	that reinforce their ideas.

	The growing complexity and quantity of online interactions requires us to
	find new techniques for detecting Echo Chambers. In this
	work we propose the \acrfull{ECP} and the \acrfull{D-ECP}, new formulations
	that take into account the concepts of \emph{content} (the piece of
	information that is discussed) and \emph{thread} (the "locality"
	discussing the content) in finding polarization.

	Our idea is that Echo Chambers correspond to groups of users discussing a content
	which is \emph{controversial}, i.e.\ globally triggers many hostile
	interactions, with no \emph{controversy}, i.e.\ with
	mainly friendly interactions inside the Echo Chamber.

	We will show that the problems we propose are hard to approximate within
	any non-trivial factor and propose \acrfull{MIP} models and
	heuristics for solving them. Finally, we will focus on one of these
	methods and show that it is able to find Echo Chambers in synthetic data
	but has some limitations when applied to real-world data.

	% Our work sheds light on a more expressive view of the problem and its
	% complexity, giving future research a new starting point for detecting
	% polarization in social media.
