I would like to express my deep and sincere gratitude to the people that helped and
guided me through these months of research: my supervisor, Dr. Stefan Neumann,
my examiner, Professor
Aristides Gionis, and Professor Aris Anagnostopoulos, who joined
us in this adventure. Their friendship and support during this period have been
invaluable.

I am also grateful to my family and friends for supporting me through
all these years.
