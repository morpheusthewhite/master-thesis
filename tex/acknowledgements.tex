First of all I would like to deeply thank all that people helped me and gave me
suggestions during this month of research, motivating me and allowing me to
feel as one of their collegues: Dr. Stefan Neumann, my supervisor, Professor
Aristides Gionis, my examiner, and Professor Aris Anagnostopoulos, Professor at
Sapienza University of Rome, who joined us in this adventure.

I would also like to thank all my family and friends for supporting me through
all this years.
